# Supply &amp; Command

Supply &amp; Command is an early-stage strategy game that simulates the complex dynamics of global trade and resource management. The game is based on the interactions between different countries, each with their unique needs and resources.

In the game, each country has a set of needs and a stockpile of resources. The countries trade resources based on their needs and the availability of resources in other countries. The game uses a sophisticated algorithm to determine which country trades with whom and how much resource is traded, based on the severity of the need and the price of the resource.

Additionally, each country has a domestic production rate for each resource, which is added to the country's stockpile at each turn.

The game is currently in its early development stages, and the code provided in Program.cs is a sneak peek into the core mechanics of the game. The code snippet shows how the game calculates trades between countries, domestic production, and outputs the state of each country.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop and refine the mechanics of Supply &amp; Command!
